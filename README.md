# GreenBot


###This is a naive chat bot using events and api calls through TwitchLib

ChatReader 
- Maybe basic stop/stall functionality
- Display name and message of all oncoming messages
- Handle unique messages/command identifiers
- send messages from window
    - possibly whispers as well

ChatBot
* More featured events
- Implementation of TwitchLib library

ChatController (TODO)
* Customize layout
- Allow user to change channels
    - Allow user to input custom moderator controls and events
    - Customized responses from user
